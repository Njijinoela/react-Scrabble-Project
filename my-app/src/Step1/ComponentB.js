                    Scrabble is a classic word game where players score points by forming
                    words from individual letter tiles on a game board.<br />Each letter
                    tile has a point value, and players arrange these tiles on a 15x15 grid
                    to create words, much like a crossword puzzle.<br />The goal is to score
                    the most points by creating high-scoring words, often by taking
                    advantage of bonus squares on the board (like double or triple
                    letter/word scores). <br />The game combines vocabulary, strategy, and
                    sometimes luck with the letter tiles drawn.
